# Algorithm-for-Bengali-Error-Dataset-Generation
We present a unique algorithm for Bengali that can be used to generate an error or misspelled word like we often do while writing Bengali through English Qwerty keyboard.

1. "ErrorWordGenaratorTool.ipynb": We have developed an error word generation tool. By using this code anyone can generate an error word from correct word. Give a Correct word as Input and Output will be a wrong word in the console.

2. "Juktakkhor List.txt": We show 170 common constant words (Juktakkhor) of Bengali language.

3."Juktakkhor-handling-rules.pdf": We proposed 20 rules for handling Juktakkhor while generating errors.

4." Phonetic Similar Cluster Replacement.txt": We proposed a Dictionary for which character is phonetically similar.

5." Single Letter Mispressed Cluster Replacement.txt": We proposed a Dictionary for which adjacent character mapping has been done on the QWERTY keyboard layout.

6."Single letter Mispressed cluster insertion.txt": We proposed a Dictionary for which character insertion is possible because of adjacency in the QWERTY keyboard layout.
